# CRISP_DM-data-analysis
Automating the Classification of Legal Documents Using CRISP-DM

 Project Overview
Automated **legal document classification** using Data Analysis to reduce manual review time and errors, improving efficiency and accuracy.

 Business Problem
J.P. Morgan spends **360,000 hours** annually reviewing loan agreements. **COIN (Contract Intelligence)** automates this process, cutting time and errors significantly.

 Data Understanding
- Sources: Legal documents (loan agreements, credit-default swaps, custody agreements).
- Format: PDFs, Word documents.
- Exploration: Text analysis to classify clause types and ensure data quality.

 Data Preparation
- Cleaning: Standardized document format.
- Feature Extraction: Identified key clauses.
- Splitting: Created training, validation, and test sets.

 Modelling
- Used Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, LSTMs for classification.
- Applied cross-validation for accuracy.
- Performed error analysis to refine models.

 Evaluation
- Compared model performance on validation data.


 Deployment
- Integrated into **document management system**.
- Used **APIs/cloud services** for scalability.
- Enabled **real-time processing**.

 Monitoring & Maintenance
- Continuous performance tracking.
- Regular updates for **new regulations**.

 Conclusion
Using **CRISP-DM methodology**, this solution enhances **efficiency, scalability, and accuracy**, transforming legal document review.
